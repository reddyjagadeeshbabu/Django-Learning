Day-3


Creating the Polls app:

Now go to pycharm and open the project like Internship Project.
- open myproject folder and in myporject folder now creating name with Polls and it is a package.
- now open pycharm terminla and rum this command (python manage.py startapp polls) an dnow structure like this


That’ll create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:

polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py

This directory structure will house the poll application.

Step-1: write ypur fist view:

Let’s write the first view. Open the file polls/views.py and put the following Python code in it:


from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")


-This is the most basic view possible in Django. To access it in a browser, we need to map it to a URL - and for this we need to define a URL configuration, or “URLconf” for short. These URL configurations are defined inside each Django app, and they are Python files named urls.py.
